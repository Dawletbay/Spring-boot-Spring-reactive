# spring-reactive

    This project is a part of the project working on Spring reactive, of course I deleted many parts of the project.
    I wanted to share it with you. If you see some flaws, don't pay attention, because writing clean code is not for everyone.

# In the project I used the following.

    Spring Reactive WebFlux sample projects;
    Spring boot;
    Reactive web;
    Reactive security;
    Reactive web client;
    Postgresql driver;
    Reactive R2DBC;
    Reactive functional;
    RabbitMq;
    Flyway;
